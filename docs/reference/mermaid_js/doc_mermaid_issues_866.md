## 1. Overview

Mermaid is a JavaScript library that turns plain text into diagrams and flowcharts.  
It is used in editors, wikis, documentation sites, and many other tooling ecosystems.

> **Why Mermaid?**  
> * “I started this project by myself in the second half of 2014 mainly for my own needs for documentation.” – *knsv*  
> * “Open source in action. Many people started using it, many people added support for mermaid in their editors/wikis etc.” – *knsv*  

The project is actively maintained and welcomes community contributions.
