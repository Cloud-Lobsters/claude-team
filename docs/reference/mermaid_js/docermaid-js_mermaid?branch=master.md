## 5. How to Use This Report

1. **Identify Coverage Gaps**  
   - Look at the *Branches Covered* and *Relevant Lines Covered* percentages.  
   - Focus on directories with lower coverage (e.g., `packages/` at 55.51 %).

2. **Investigate Recent Builds**  
   - Review the commit messages of recent builds to understand what changes were introduced.  
   - If a build is pending completion, check the CI logs for failures.

3. **Improve Coverage**  
   - Add unit tests for uncovered branches or lines.  
   - Use the *Hits per Line* metric to identify heavily exercised code.

4. **Track Progress**  
   - Monitor the *Last Build* and *Recent Builds* sections to see how coverage evolves over time.
